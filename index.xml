This blog digital garden will hopefully serve as a index for those findings, and an excuse for me to properly research and document them for myself and others.
The inspiration for me to use the term &amp;ldquo;digital garden&amp;rdquo; should be primarily attributed to this post by Joel Hooks, which in turn led me to another interesting piece, building a digital garden by Tom Critchlow.</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://sanchithhegde.github.io/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sanchithhegde.github.io/projects/</guid><description>Some projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on and contributed to include:

I use VS Code with the Ayu Dark theme for most of my development work. The only exception is when I&amp;rsquo;m working on something Android related, for which I use Android Studio. I also tend to use micro for quick edits on the terminal.</description></item></channel></rss>
