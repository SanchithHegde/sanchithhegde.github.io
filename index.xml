This blog digital garden will hopefully serve as a index for those findings, and an excuse for me to properly research and document them for myself and others.
The inspiration for me to use the term &amp;ldquo;digital garden&amp;rdquo; should be primarily attributed to this post by Joel Hooks, which in turn led me to another interesting piece, building a digital garden by Tom Critchlow.</description></item></channel></rss>
