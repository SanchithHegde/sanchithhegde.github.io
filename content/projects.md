Some projects I've worked on and contributed to include:

- [One-click attendance using facial recognition][attendance]:
  Our submission for YI (Young Indians) InnovIndia-2020 Virtual Hackathon 2020
  conducted on the 31st July, 2020.
  We were one among the two winners from Mysuru.
- [Tic-Tac-Toe Android game][tic-tac-toe]:
  Single-player Tic-Tac-Toe game implementing the Monte-Carlo tree search
  algorithm, in Java.

Apart from these, I've worked on some projects as part of my academics:

- Developed a simple
  [university practical examination scheduling system][university-exam-scheduling]
  as part of my database management systems course.
- Case study on Raspbian, the Debian-based OS for the Raspberry Pi as part of
  my Operating Systems course.
- Simulated the Linux process scheduler, the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) in
  [Python][cfs] as part of the Raspbian case study.
- Implemented and visualized the Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm in
  [Python][bm-py] (and later in [Rust][bm-rs] when learning it) as part of my
  Design and Analysis of Algorithms course.

I've contributed to a few open-source projects as well.
