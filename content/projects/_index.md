Some projects I've worked on and contributed to include:

- [One-click attendance using facial recognition](https://github.com/yi-hackathon-2020/attendance-facial-recognition):
  Our submission for YI (Young Indians) InnovIndia-2020 Virtual Hackathon 2020
  conducted on the 31st July, 2020. We were one among the two winners from
  Mysuru.
- [Tic-Tac-Toe Android game](https://github.com/SanchithHegde/tic-tac-toe-android/):
  Single-player Tic-Tac-Toe game implementing the Monte-Carlo tree search
  algorithm, in Java.

Apart from these, I've worked on some projects as part of my academics:

- Case study on Raspbian, the Debian-based OS for the Raspberry Pi as part of
  my Operating Systems course.
- Simulated the Linux process scheduler, the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) in
  [Python](https://github.com/SanchithHegde/completely-fair-scheduler) as part
  of the Raspbian case study.
- Implemented and visualized the Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm in
  [Python](https://github.com/SanchithHegde/boyer-moore-visualization-python)
  (and later in [Rust](https://github.com/SanchithHegde/boyer-moore-visualization-rs)
  when learning it) as part of my Design and Analysis of
  Algorithms course.

I've contributed to a few open-source projects as well.
