## Editor + Terminal

I use `Konsole` that ships with the KDE Plasma desktop environment with `zsh`
along with [`zinit`](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit) plugin manager and
[`powerlevel10k`](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme on my Arch
Linux system.
I use VS Code with the
[Ayu Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu)
theme for most of my development work.
The only exception is when I'm working on something Android related, for which I
use Android Studio.
I also tend to use [`micro`](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) for quick edits
on the terminal.

All my config files can be found in my
[dotfiles repo](https://github.com/SanchithHegde/dotfiles).
