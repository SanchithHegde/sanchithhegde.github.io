With Linux being my primary OS for development and daily use, I come across a
lot of new things (Linux-specific and otherwise) on the daily, which help
improve my development experience and sometimes increase productivity.
This ~~blog~~ _digital garden_ will hopefully serve as a index for those
findings, and an excuse for me to properly research and document them for myself
and others.

The inspiration for me to use the term "digital garden" should be primarily
attributed to [this post][joel hooks] by Joel Hooks, which in turn led me to
another interesting piece, [building a digital garden][tom critchlow] by Tom
Critchlow.
